# "Guess the Number" Game
Let's play game in which Computer have to find out the number we have guessed.

Initially Computer gets the lower and the higher bounds of the range hidden number belongs to.
After every wrong try Computer will be told if predicted number is more or if it's less than the one we made.

Thanks to game rules Computer has unlimited tries so it has no chance to loose. 
We just want to know how many tries Computer will take.
