# "Guess the Number"
This is a learning project made to study Python and acquire skills working with VS Code and GitHub. 

Theme of the project is the game called "Guess the number". In this game a Computer should find out the guessed number.

Rules are simple. Computer gets the lower and the upper bounds of the range hidden number belongs to. Then Computer predicts numbers until it guesses hidden number, which is always integer by the way. After every wrong try Computer gets information if predicted number is more or if it's less than the one we made.

Thanks to game rules Computer has unlimited tries so it can't loose. 

The result is a number of tries taken by Computer.
