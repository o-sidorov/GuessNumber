# "Guess the Number" Game
Let's play game in which Computer finds out the number we have guessed.

Initially Computer gets the lower and the upper bounds of the range hidden number belongs to. Then Computer predicts numbers until it guesses our number, which is always integer by the way. After every wrong try Computer will be told if predicted number is more or if it's less than the one we made.

Thanks to game rules Computer has unlimited tries so it has no chance to loose. 

The result is how many tries Computer will take.

Game algorythm is placed in the only function â€“ guess_number()
