    "\n",
    "* Initially Computer gets the lower and the upper bounds of the range hidden number belongs to. \n",
    "* Computer predicts numbers until it guesses our number, which is always integer by the way. \n",
    "* After every wrong try Computer will be told if predicted number is more or if it's less \n",
    "than the one we made.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to game rules Computer has unlimited tries so it has no chance to loose. \n",
    "\n",
    "So the result of the game is a number of tries Computer will take.\n",

    "### Game algorythm \n",
    "Game algoryth is placed in the only function – *guess_number()* from guess_number.py module."
